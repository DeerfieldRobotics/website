                <div>Albert Einstein's groundbreaking contributions to science and his relentless pursuit of knowledge have profoundly inspired the FIRST Robotics community. His curiosity, creativity, and innovative thinking embody the core values of FIRST â€” to inspire young minds to explore science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Einstein's famous belief that "Imagination is more important than knowledge" resonates deeply with the mission of FIRST, encouraging students to think beyond limits, solve complex problems, and push the boundaries of what is possible. By embodying Einstein's spirit of discovery and innovation, FIRST Robotics empowers the next generation of inventors and engineers to shape a brighter future.</div>
