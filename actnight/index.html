                    <span class="p">Deerfield Robotics is a club at DHS that runs and manages three teams. These teams are a part of the FIRST Tech Challenge, the global league for robotics.</span>

                    <span class="p">If you want to join, or are even interested, add yourself to the interest form and we'll email you regarding the upcoming season. Even if you aren't that interested, we still recommend you come to the boot camp!</span>

                    <span class="p"><strong>Eligibility</strong><br /> All DHS Students</span>

                    <span class="p"><strong>Time Period</strong><br /> Sept-Nov: Planning, Design, and Build<br /> Nov-Feb: League, Regional, and State Meets<br /> Feb-May: Postseason (optional)</span>

                    <span class="p"><strong>Meetings</strong><br /> Tuesday-Thursday, 3:15-5:30 PM in J111<br /> Recommended commitment level is 1-2 times/week<br /> Meeting times are more frequent during week leading up to meets<br /> Held in dedicated lab space</span>
